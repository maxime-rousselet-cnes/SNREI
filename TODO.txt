Verif k2:
    tested elastic only. OK
    tested k_2 -> ok with uncertainties for A and B but not C
        (3375-c3d6-ddb6-2967: 4, 100 points per layer)
        (91e5-67d2-e762-970f: 100, 10000 points per layer)
        NOT THE SAME CURBS!!! -> r function sampling were unsufficients -> test with 100000 points: 7bb3-a52c-2f7f-ef2a -> same than 10000
    with 2*pi error and 0.04 bias, results ok for A, B and C!

Urgent:
    verify curbs and k_2 with new pulsation/frequency differenciation -> OK
    check integration __init__ -> OK
    plot fr and fi -> OK
    plot mu(r) -> OK
    comparative plots for h, k, k'... -> OK
    comparative_for sampling with realistic omega band and script 06 that calls script function 02 and plot 07 with better inputs for fewer figures -> OK

    Look at Alex's article (CNES mail)
    README.md infography for code documentation
    select plots
    LaTeX disponible figures


Soon:
    Ocean mask + Caron load from raw files (Barystatic) to ocean_load: result[n, m, T] script
    FT periodic to ocean_load_Fourier: result[n, m, frequency]
    get deformation_Fourier : result[n, m, frequency]
    get deformation: result[theta, phi, T]
    save

later:
    forgot the 3 in Lamba_0 expression in LaTeX
    Vectorize and implement minimal computing policy for:
        integration.py: y_system_integration method and subfunctions
        surface_solutiuons.py
        system_definitions.py

To talk about 14/02:
    - discuss on the needed bounded f_r and f_i (depends on T)
