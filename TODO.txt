Verif k2:
    tested elastic only. OK
    tested k_2 -> ok with uncertainties for A and B but not C (3375-c3d6-ddb6-2967: 4, 100 points per layer)

Currently running:
    same plot but with lot of points

Urgent:
    plot fr and fi
    plot mu(r)

Soon:
    Ocean mask + Caron load from raw files to ocean_load: result[n, m, T] script
    FT periodic to ocean_load_Fourier: result[n, m, omega]
    get deformation_Fourier : result[n, m, omega]
    get deformation: result[theta, phi, T]
    save


later:
    comparative plots from result script 03
    forgot the 3 in Lamba_0 expression in LaTeX
    Vectorize and implement minimal computing policy for:
        integration.py: y_system_integration method and subfunctions
        surface_solutiuons.py
        system_definitions.py
