CURRENTLY:
    Running for Q312 oand Q30. Check curbs with 3rd pannel
TODO:
    rename anelasticity and attenuation
    automatic below_icb/cmb_layers with anelasticity_description splitted layer names in real anelasticity_description
    pass zoom_in limits as parameters in plot functions instead of hard code
    Add loop with/without anelasticity in plot Love 4
    do load scripts looping on descriptions
    README.md infography for code documentation
    select plots / plots_Love_numbers
    LaTeX disponible figures
    verify all plot script descriptions
    verify if the same anelasticity_description is passed for every degree for initial frequencies.
    add simlink in results varying asymptotic ratio for unbounded attenuation functions.
    reorg script indices.
    loop on plot script 06

later:
    Vectorize and implement minimal computing policy for:
        integration.py: y_system_integration method and subfunctions
        surface_solutiuons.py
        system_definitions.py
    refactoring: description/runs nomenclature in figures too.
